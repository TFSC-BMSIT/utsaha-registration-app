# Utsaha Registration App
The registration app used by volunteers to register participants at Utsaha 2015.

Integrates with the Solutions Infini SMS gateway to send transactional SMS receipts.

Built using Ruby on Rails *over a two day period*, so please make sure to test thoroughly before using it in a production environment.
